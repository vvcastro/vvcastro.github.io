Double degree student in Computer Science at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it).

I am writing my thesis under the supervision of [Manuel Roveri](https://roveri.faculty.polimi.it) on using **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** for **Continual Learning** problems. Broadly speaking, I am studying _plasticity_ and _stability_ in deep neural networks to find the best expansion for a given model.
