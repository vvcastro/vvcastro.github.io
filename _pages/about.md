I am writing my _Master's Thesis_ under the supervision of [Manuel Roveri](https://roveri.faculty.polimi.it) on using **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** for **Continual Learning** problems. Broadly, I am studying _plasticity_ and _stability_ in deep neural networks to find the best model expansion to be able to learn new samples, but also retain the previously learnt data.

I have two other research projects going on with the [iHealth Institute](https://i-health.cl):

- Studying how **Meta-Learned Initialisations** affect the performance of _Implicit Neural Representations_ for MRI imaging. Through our method we reduced the training time by x6 factor. These and some other interesting results will be available in the **incoming paper**!

- In a more recent project, we are proposing a method to extend a **Gaussian Splatting** method to the _K-Space_ (or Fourier Space). This allows us to perform a **joint optimisation over both domains**, improving performance and training times over previous method.
